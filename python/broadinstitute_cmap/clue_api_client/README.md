Simple class for querying the CLUE API

Works with Python 2.7.11; requires the requests library
 
For example usage, see test_clue_api_client

Queries that are related to specific collections are gathered into 
python modules to enable re-use and to be a layer so that when/if API changes occur, code updates just need to occur here
